# Repository-for-a-1v1-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-created-in-python
This is tic-tac-toe game created in Python. If anyone can spot any improvement please let me know 
Here, who ever enters X will get treated as player 1. Also even if player 1 wins you'll need type player 2 move to know that player 1 has won. So if you can improve these things help will be much appreciated!!
This code is written in the easiest way possible.
